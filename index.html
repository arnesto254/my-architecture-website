        <h2>About Architecture</h2>
        <p>Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other
            structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols
            and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural
            achievements.</p>

            <h3>Gothic Architecture</h3>
            <p>Gothic architecture is a style that flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. It evolved
                from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Its characteristics include
                the pointed arch, the ribbed vault, and the flying buttress.</p>

            <h3>Baroque Architecture</h3>
            <p>Baroque architecture began in the late 16th century in Italy and took the Roman vocabulary of the
                Renaissance and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the
                Catholic Church and the absolutist state.</p>

            <h3>Modern Architecture</h3>
            <p>Modern architecture, or modernist architecture, is a style of architecture that emerged in the first half
                of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II. It emphasizes function, simplicity, and a
                lack of ornamentation.</p>
